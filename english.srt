1
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,660
Are you being serious?!

2
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,120
We can't take him into the Sovereignty!

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,160
If we do that...

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,370
Torture, a life sentence, or even death
would be waiting for an ex-Saint Disciple!

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,080
Rin, this is an order!

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,040
We cannot take him into the Sovereignty,
especially not Central Province!

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,740
And what if Iska escapes?
The palace will be dead ahead!

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,620
I understand.

9
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,540
Then we'll head to the closest
Nebulis territory from here.

10
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,080
The closest?

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,540
Isn't that...

12
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,630
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World

13
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,620
Successor of the Black Steel, Iska.

14
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,990
He has been kidnapped by the Ice Calamity Witch
in Neutral city, of all places.

15
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,200
That appears to be the case,
but it does not hinder our plan.

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,990
You just focus on the secret op.

17
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,240
Well, that was what I planned on doing,

18
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,290
but His Excellency made me put a pin in it.

19
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,540
What?!

20
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,580
His Excellency certainly is fickle.

21
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,700
Then what would you do, Risya?

22
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,990
Witnesses saw the vehicle that we
think was used in the kidnapping.

23
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,490
Judging from their direction,
they're likely headed to

24
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,870
the Nebulis Sovereignty Province 13, Alcatroz.

25
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,950
Also known as the Prison Sector.

26
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,740
The one who went against
the former Queen Nebulis,

27
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,830
the Heretical Demon, Salinger,
is also held there.

28
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:19,450
If we can free him,
it just might work out for the Empire.

29
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,290
It is no easy feat to win Salinger
the Transcendent to our side, but...

30
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,410
It is worth trying.

31
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,490
Risya, do what you will.

32
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,410
I plan on doing just that.

33
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,700
Thanks for waiting, guys!

34
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,120
This was a tough break, huh?

35
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,990
What's with the past tense?

36
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,870
Oops, sorry about that.

37
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,120
We're allowed to go save Iska, right?!

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,700
Of course. But as you know,

39
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,200
the astral power trial at the border
makes it hard to get into the Sovereignty.

40
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,080
That's where this comes in.

41
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,450
I told you I had a trick up
my sleeve to pass the trial.

42
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,370
Is that astral energy?!

43
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,200
Wh-What does this mean?

44
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,700
It works like this, Nens.

45
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,160
There.

46
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,950
What are you doing, Risya?!

47
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,660
Have I become a witch?

48
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,620
Just the outermost layer of the skin,
and only for a week.

49
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:47,160
This gadget emits concentrated astral energy
to stamp an astral crest on your skin.

50
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,950
How disturbing. Courtesy of the Empire's
top-secret astral power research?

51
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,490
So we're going undercover as astral mages
to get across the border?

52
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,150
Mm-hm.

53
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,620
Looks like it.

54
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,040
Boss, give me your left shoulder.

55
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,950
Huh?

56
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,370
Will this work, Miss Saint Disciple?

57
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,080
Hey, that looks pretty good.
Just like the real deal.

58
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,410
Huh?! Oh, ha, ha, ha, d-don't tease me, Risya...

59
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,330
Jhin, where do you want yours?

60
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,620
On my leg.

61
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,990
After you cross
the Nebulis Sovereignty's border,

62
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,290
you'll head for Alcatroz
and covertly look for Iska.

63
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,330
And when we find him?

64
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,830
Wreak havoc.

65
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:59,080
While you're doing that, other undercover units
will create diversions, too.

66
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,580
The rest of the unit will take advantage
of the confusion and enter the palace.

67
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,240
To carry out the plan to capture Queen Nebulis?

68
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
I'm counting on ya!

69
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,200
Lady Alice, we've arrived in Alcatroz.

70
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,790
Head towards our lodging.

71
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,870
Of course.

72
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,290
Hey, what am I to do with you?

73
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,290
You won't wake up, will you?

74
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,830
Oh, wow. I'm impressed.

75
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,040
Yeah!

76
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,830
Mine is softer than yours.

77
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,330
That's one win for me.

78
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,080
How frightening... You're my enemy,
but you make me forget that.

79
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,790
Hey, Rin!

80
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,580
It was an alley cat. I apologize.

81
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,490
Be careful.

82
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,740
Huh?! Oh, no! I-I'm sorry.

83
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,080
Lady Alice?

84
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,870
I-It's nothing, Rin.
You just keep your eyes on the road!

85
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,370
You're awake?!

86
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,910
Alice...

87
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,870
Hey, Rin! You said he wouldn't
wake up until at least tomorrow!

88
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,870
H-He wasn't supposed to!

89
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,580
Just how strong is his drug tolerance?

90
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,450
Oh, i-it looks like you remember.

91
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,330
You're in our custody.

92
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,040
Just remember that it's your fault
for drinking that spiked juice!

93
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,290
Wow, Alice...

94
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,410
Wh-What?

95
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,490
I'm disappointed in you.

96
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,700
Huh?

97
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,950
The princess of the Nebulis Sovereignty
playing such a dirty trick?

98
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,950
That's not true! I didn't order it!

99
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,830
Rin went and acted on her own accord!

100
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,990
H-Hold on, Lady Alice!
I didn't think this would happen, either!

101
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,120
This is all your fault, Imperial swordsman!
How dare you be tricked so easily?!

102
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,790
The one doing the poisoning is 100% at fault!

103
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,700
You're free to pass.

104
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,950
We got through step one...

105
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,700
Next person, show me your astral crest.

106
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,200
Sorry for the wait, Jhin!

107
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,740
Jhin, how'd you finish so fast?

108
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,580
You guys are just slow.
Anyway, the next part is the hard part.

109
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,330
Keep your guard up.

110
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,790
Okay.

111
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,950
Iska, please be safe...

112
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:26,290
Good job, Unit N07.
Looks like it went without a hitch.

113
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:32,660
But this is as far as we can help.
Everything else is on you.

114
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,450
We're here, Lady Alice.

115
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,080
Imperial soldier, you're now
inside the Sovereignty.

116
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,790
You have no allies here.
Don't go screaming just because you can.

117
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,540
Follow me. You're Lady Alice's prisoner.

118
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,330
What... is this place?

119
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,040
I'm so tired. A car ride has
never been this tense.

120
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,660
Lady Alice, I have reserved another room.

121
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,580
We can chain him up
in there as his holding cell.

122
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,450
No. I bet you just got the smallest room, too.

123
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,790
I don't want any rumors spreading that
a princess treated her prisoner poorly.

124
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,700
H-However, this swordsman is dangerous!

125
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,040
Who knows when he'll attack you, Lady Alice!

126
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,540
Even without a sword?

127
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,490
Even without a sword!

128
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:56,120
All men are animals!
He'll try to attack you in your sleep--

129
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,200
What are you talking about?!

130
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:09,580
Fine. Then I will stay here and you can take
the presidential suite next door.

131
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,870
So you'll watch him? Okay.

132
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,870
Take good care of him.

133
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,990
Of course.

134
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,490
Hiya, everyone! I'm glad you all made it!

135
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,870
Risya!

136
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,540
So? How's your first time in the Sovereignty?

137
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,080
I've heard about it, but this province
really is full of prisons.

138
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,950
Convicts from within and throughout
are gathered here in Province 13, Alcatroz.

139
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:57,450
They prospered by having other nations
pay them to imprison violent criminals.

140
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,790
Those criminals are astral mages?

141
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:06,790
Correctomundo. One of the more
violent criminals, the Transce... Oops.

142
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:12,910
Oh, Jhin-Jhin, head down and take a left.
Then keep going straight.

143
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,330
Um, can you actually see us?

144
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,990
Ah, good guess, Nens!

145
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,080
Hiya!

146
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,240
Huh? Why are you here, Risya?

147
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,620
How could I possibly let
my precious Mismis go without me?

148
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,330
So now that we're all here, let's go, shall we?

149
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,830
Wh-Where to?

150
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,740
Where Issy is being held captive.

151
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,040
Ollelugan Prison Tower, here we come!

152
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,040
The last time I stood before you
was in that forest.

153
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,990
I guess so.

154
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,120
This is the go-to hotel
used by the Nebulis royals.

155
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,910
We will keep you here
until we decide what to do with you.

156
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,660
At least, that is Lady Alice's plan.

157
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,040
Alice's?

158
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,790
That is too risky.

159
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,790
I see you as a threat
better than Lady Alice does.

160
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,990
That is why...

161
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,660
What are you...?

162
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,660
This is how the story goes.

163
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,620
Seeing the knife on the table,
you grabbed it and attacked me.

164
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,540
My injury proves that.

165
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,950
Huh? But you did that...

166
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,990
This backs up my story of self-defense.

167
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:52,240
A dangerous Imperial soldier cannot be only
monitored . He must be imprisoned .

168
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,410
Hold on...

169
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,370
Imperial swordsman, Iska... You're done.

170
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,200
You're joking!

171
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,580
I am not!

172
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,490
You will become the greatest obstacle
to Lady Alice's goal of world unification!

173
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,700
Hence my decision.

174
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,830
You're a necessary sacrifice to unite the world.
Your dream come true!

175
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,540
That's definitely not my dream come true!

176
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,540
Maybe I'll have cold tomato pasta for dinner.

177
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,740
Oh, no. Rin will scold me again
if she sees me like this.

178
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,740
Now that Iska's my prisoner,
I shouldn't be too nice to him.

179
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,830
Hey, Rin, about tonight's dinner--

180
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,290
Impressive how you stopped
my attack despite being cuffed...

181
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,620
You won't kill me that easily...

182
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,700
Oh, Alice! Hey, servant, your master's back!

183
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,790
Ha! Don't be an idiot!
I will not fall for such a blatant lie.

184
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,080
If Lady Alice is truly here,
why hasn't she stopped me?

185
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,040
I was just about to do that.

186
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,450
Looks like you're having fun. May I join?

187
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,080
Lady Alice...?

188
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,790
This sure is a heavily guarded prison...

189
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,290
We barely got in with
Miss Saint Disciple's help, but...

190
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,040
Risya went her separate way.

191
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,910
I wonder if Iska is really here?

192
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:51,290
Saint Disciples are the Emperor's guards.
They rarely leave the capital.

193
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,240
If they weren't sure Iska was here,
they wouldn't be here. But...

194
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,580
But if they have a different agenda,
something other than rescuing Iska...

195
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,830
Lady Alice, everything is arranged.

196
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,240
However, I am reluctant about this...

197
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,910
It's your fault for assaulting Iska twice.
You may go now.

198
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,080
All right. Please be careful...

199
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:32,410
So, I'll be watching over you myself.
You should feel honored.

200
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,660
Alice?

201
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,950
Yes?

202
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,870
Are we going to stay like this?

203
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,120
Of course. Rin said you cannot be trusted
with just the cuffs on.

204
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,370
What?

205
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,660
Well, can I ask you a weird question?

206
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,490
Just so you know, it's impossible to
get you out of them. Rin has the keys.

207
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,290
How will we use the bathroom?

208
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,740
Huh?

209
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,740
Or bathe, or go to bed?

210
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,580
This is bad! Why didn't you
point this out earlier?!

211
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,490
Wait, was this your plan all along...?
I never pegged you for a pervert!

212
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,950
It doesn't take much thinking!

213
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,330
But...

214
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,990
Alice?

215
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:35,580
N-Now that you mention it...
Since this whole ordeal, I haven't gone...

216
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,620
To the bath--

217
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:43,370
Don't say it! Rin, we have an emergency!
Bring me the keys!

218
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,910
You excused her just moments ago.

219
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,450
Rin?!

220
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,910
Don't even think of anything evil.

221
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,790
You won't even get one step
into Lady Alice's bathroom.

222
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,790
You meant evil in that sense?!

223
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:20,160
I have a question.
What are you going to do with me?

224
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,740
Keep you locked away in this place forever.
That's what I propose.

225
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,450
Lady Alice offered you a deal once.
You just didn't take it.

226
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,790
After that, I have no reason to show you mercy.

227
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,240
However, that is simply my opinion.

228
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,080
Phew. I finally feel refreshed.

229
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,740
Hey, about my change of clothes...

230
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:54,740
No! Iska, wait, I didn't mean to!
I forgot you were here!

231
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,990
Astral crest?

232
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:11,120
Iska, what do you think when you see this?

233
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,040
Curse of the demon, an unknown disease,
mark of a monster rearing its face...

234
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,620
I know that's what the Empire calls it.

235
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,870
Lady Alice!

236
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,700
Don't misunderstand me, Rin.
I don't care what they think.

237
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,160
No matter what anyone calls it,
I'm proud of my astral crest.

238
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,620
But for some reason,
I want to know what you think of it.

239
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,870
There's this captain at the Empire
who became a "witch."

240
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,200
That person is still a captain at the Empire.

241
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Whether she's a witch or has
an astral crest, I still respect her.

242
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,410
Is the astral crest the reason why
this war has continued for 100 years?

243
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,870
Is the reason we fight because
of some silly reason like that?

244
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,120
No. I'm with the Empire
and you're with the Sovereignty.

245
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,290
Which nation we were born in...

246
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,330
It's our ideas and positions that divide us.

247
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,990
The reason I fight is not
because of the astral crest.

248
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,830
You're right.

249
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,790
So, you're saying you don't
care about my astral crest?

250
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,490
Do you even have to ask?

251
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:38,290
Then, what do you think of me?
Aside from being a witch?

252
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,330
A rival on the battlefield.

253
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,200
Insolent fool! How dare you, a lowly soldier,
see Lady Alice as your rival?!

254
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,120
It's fine.

255
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,580
Yes, it's fi-- What?!

256
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,870
I feel like this fog has lifted from my heart.

257
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,540
That's right. That's the answer I wanted.

258
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,990
A brazen boy who doesn't treat me special.
That's the way you should be.

259
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,580
Alice, I also have something important to say.

260
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,080
What is it?

261
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,240
Um... I'd really appreciate it
if you'd wear something now...

262
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,540
I-Iska! Just where do you think you're ogling?!

263
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,830
But you're the one showing it off!

264
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,080
That was not my intention!

265
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,450
This isn't fair, Iska! If you're my rival,
you'll show your naked body, too!

266
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,790
Now take off your clothes!

267
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,950
A-Alice, you're not making sense!

268
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,990
Lady Alice, have you lost it?!

269
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,330
Don't you run away!

270
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,540
You may introduce yourself,
visitor from the Empire.

271
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm Risya In Empire. Did I need
to make an appointment?

272
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,040
The Transcendent Demon, Salinger?

273
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,040
Paradise:
Alice's Longest Night
